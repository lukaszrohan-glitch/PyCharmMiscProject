SMB Tool — Frontend (React + Vite)

Quick start (requires Node.js >= 18 and npm/yarn)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs by default at http://localhost:5173 and expects the backend at http://localhost:8000 (see `.env`).

In WebStorm: File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources -> select this folder. Or open the `frontend` folder as a project.

API base is configurable in `.env` (VITE_API_BASE).
